# Discord-Story-Mode
Heavily work in progress Discord bot that supports Turn Based RPG Style Battles, Cutscenes, and potentially more stuff down the line.

This project currently doesent do very much, but if you want to try it anyways, you will need to create a discord bot at https://www.discord.com/developers, and replace the TOKEN Variable in Main.py with your bot's token. Then run Main.py. The project has only been tested against Python versions 3.9-3.10, but it may work on older versions as well.
