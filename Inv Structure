Item Stats are stored inside of the Items table, each row corresponds to a property
Row corresponds to the index of the property in a list/tuple, cause I switched this from a SQL table to a Python file
Row 0 = Type #Valid types are WEAPON,ARMOR,STATUS,KEY
Row 1 = Strength (Damage if its a weapon, Damage Reduction if its an armor, heal points if its a restorative item, etc. should be 0 for key items)
Row 2 = Maximum Durability???
Row 3 = What slot(s) it equips to #Valid slots are L_HAND,R_HAND,CHEST,LEG,HEAD
Row 4 = Weight in Kilos
